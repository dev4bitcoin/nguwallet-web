                    The NguWallet is built by desire to learn and give back to Bitcoin community.

                    I am a software developer who is completely addicted to Bitcoin. I also want to help other developers and beginners to play with the wallets without fear of losing their funds.

                    The app works exactly as mainnet network and all the code is open and free. Application is also tested in mainnet network, but I decided to keep it only for testnet because there is more to be done.
